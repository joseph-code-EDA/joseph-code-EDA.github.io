          <h4>Process Over Product</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                As clear as the brief was in it's time allowance, I knew that I would exceed the time required to process and learn as much as possible to even produce the most basic product.<br><br>Using the Developer's Tools really helped unlock the syntax and it tool awhile for the patterns and structures to sink in before I felt comfortable building something.<br>With all the time spent I was able to build a product I am satisfied with (and still requiring a lot of tweaking).<br>And because I have the time, I'm able to explore a little more with the syntax to see what happens.<br><br>Yes, 'process over product' will be invaluable once I become more fluid & experienced - especially where time is a commodity requiring an agile response.

          <h4>Pre Meditation Thoughts</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                Over the last 15 years, meditation has been a core component of our teaching philosophy. Initially I was highly sceptical about the affect that this technique would have upon learners - but once I got over myself and "felt the power" of it - I quickly reaped the benefits that this technique offered and so did the tauira (students).<br><br>From there I researched, applied and modified techniques that particularly focus on breathing, and the inclusion of baroque music which induces alpha brainwave patterns to open deeper level concentration.<br><br>The background of this page is a place of deep meaning to me - the place where my mum and generations of whƒÅnau rest, a place that calms and alleviates the weight of the world, a place to rejuvenate, a place I call home.<br><br>Meditation is a medicine from the noise of this world, of life.

          <h4>Any New Musings?</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                Meditation has so many forms, physically, mentally, spiritually and emotionally. What seems core to all these states is the concept of breathing.<br><br>
                Personally, I don't breathe "enough"; and I need to be more aware of my breathing in response to different contexts - especially those influenced by physical exertion and emotionally charged.<br><br>This can have a massive impact on other areas in our lives if not managed. In the words of my mentor - <em>"acknowledge with honesty, accept with integrity, then let it go..."<em>
