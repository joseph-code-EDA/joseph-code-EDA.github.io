          <h4>Mindfulness Vs. Self Awareness</h4>
              <p id="answerform">
                Self Awareness and Mindfulness are essentially the same thing. They are a form of reflective-attentive practice that invites us to be more cognisant of self, where we discern rather than judge.<br><br>This means that both are able to be trained, honed like a skill and called upon when required.

          <h4>Self Awareness Practices Experience</h4>
              <p id="answerform">
                With meditation/relaxation being a core part of our teaching philosophy in my previous job, body scanning is something very familiar to me. Similarly, I would invite learners to be mindful of their breathing, the air that flowed throughout their bodies while bringing awareness to their bodies and the environment around them.<br><br>I find this technique particularly engaging, relaxing and beneficial to all. Journaling doesn't carry as much appeal as the other - however the power of self-discovery through writing is indeed a powerful technique in anchoring reflection.

          <h4>My Emotions Are Not Me Response</h4>
              <p id="answerform">
                In some relationships I've been told that I'm bereft of emotion, that I lack the emotional intelligence to connect with others, to reveal and/or share my feelings.<br> Over time I've become more aware of how my feelings affect me, and through relationships I've learned how to compartmentalize and detach my emotions, where they become a third person entity.<br> Knowing this allows me to enter relationships knowing that I can make emotionally independant decisions, and where needed, engage them.
