          <h4>New Learnings</h4>
              <p id="answerform">
                This chapter has been so insightful, in particular there were two sections that resonated deeply within me.<br><br><em>"Perceived inadequacies about ourselves"</em><br>When I read this line, it instantly triggered off a flood of memories when I had felt this way. It felt incredibly overwhelming to realise the way I had treated myself when this occured - the negative self talk, obsessive thinking and aversion that habitually fed my monsters.<br>I kept reading to find a solution to this.<br><br><em>"SiBerian North RailRoad"</em><br>This mnemonic will teach me how to live freely with myself. I've already started applying it so anytime a "perceived threat" enters I simply stop, breathe, notice, reflect and respond to myself in a meaningful, mindful manner.

          <h4>2 Minute Mindfulness</h4>
              <p id="answerform">
                I thought I was highly aware of my states, but reading this section has blown that assumption out of the water. While it's relatively easy to enter a positive state of mindfulness for me, the challenge will be mindfully navigating the mental negativity that does arise from time to time.<br><br>Indeed, it has reminded of the power of the breath and how it influences everything that flows thereafter. I really enjoyed this chapter and feel more confident in applying these techniques into everything I do. Mindfulness is such a enlightening read.
