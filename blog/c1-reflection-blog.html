    <h3>DBC | EDA Impressions</h3>
      <p>
        The DBC seemingly started off as a experiment - with a handful of tutors and a cohort of working professionals, business owners and college/university students who didn't really know what they were getting themselves into.
        The curriculum itself deviates away from the traditional consumerist "restaurant" model of education in favour of a transformational creative package where the individual determines their educational success through sharing and learning heaps by going down rabbitholes.
