          <p>
            Getting blocked is an easy thing to do. Like breathing it is a natural part of a coding ecosystem. One recurring problem I encountered was not understanding particular words within the JavaScript lexicon (like addEventListener); then searching for as many iterations and applications of that word. Google is my first go to point as it makes me feel I'm capable of discerning the answer. Sometimes though there is just too much info requiring specificity that it becomes overwhelming, then discouraging, that quickly becomes frustration resulting in blockage. Only later did I realise that I should've used Dev Tools to inspect the code to see how others were using addEventListener and seeing it in ctx|context cemented it's application. I've learned that code is sometimes better when you've got examples of code that illustrate it's function and implementation. And that if we need help - our peers would come to our assistance which was an awesome thing to have and see - especially with problematic error messages (solved via jsBin)

            <span style="color:#F3B231">Something of a more <span style="color:white"><strong><em>'eloquent'</em></strong></span> approach was trying to figure out how to get my character|racecar to move. Seeing how many others used tables and the value "active" forced me to think - are we really restricted to just tables? Of all my peers, there was one who didn't rely on a table, but created an "arena" where his characters could move.</span><span style="color:#D9F203"> After pseudocoding up my thoughts, I was surprised after inspecting their code to discover that they used three distinct code blocks, each wrapped in a function. The complexity and ingenuity of the coder told me that I could indeed learn alot from them. I deliberately broke the code apart, changed it then waited to see how the browser would react to my changes, and quickly learned the functionality and output of the code.</span> Yes, I was challenging myself to understand what was happening by unravelling code, but learned so much that I adapted some of that thinking - and since it was a racing game, themed my racer accodingly.<span style="color:#0372FA"> I learned that I'm really confident with HTML & CSS and having prunes like JavaScript along the way keeps things varied too.</span><span style="color:#FE0241"><br><br>Upon reflection, I need to be more open to engaging our coaches for their wisdom and experience and maybe then I will achieve things in a more timely fashion.</span>

            Statements like <em>"if...else"</em> are conditional and only actioned when a certain criteria has been met. <br>So if we don't check the bread for mold we could get food poisoning or else we could check the remaining bread slices to see if they're okay.<br><br><strong>Loops</strong> maintain repetition until a condition is met. <br>So, if you happen to have a whole house of guests and you were on toast duty, your job would only be complete when everyone has had enough toast to eat.
