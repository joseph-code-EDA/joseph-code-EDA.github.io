            <span style="color:#FE0241">Getting blocked is an easy thing to do. Like breathing it is a natural part of a coding ecosystem. </span><span style="color:white"> One recurring problem I encountered was not understanding particular words within the <span style="color:#F5F139">JavaScript</span> lexicon [like <span style="color:#F83BD2">addEventListener</span>]; then searching for as many iterations and applications of that word. </span><span style="color:#3275F2">G</span><span style="color:#E83225">o</span><span style="color:#FAB000">o</span><span style="color:#3275F2">g</span><span style="color:#289A41">l</span><span style="color:#E83225">e</span><span style="color:#F3B231"> is my first go to point as it makes me feel I'm capable of discerning the answer. Sometimes though there is just too much info requiring specificity that it becomes overwhelming, then discouraging, that quickly becomes frustration resulting in blockage. </span><span style="color:#0372FA">Only later did I realise that I should've used Dev Tools to inspect the code to see how others were using <span style="color:#F83BD2">addEventListener</span> and seeing it in <span style="color:#3EF3F6">ctx</span>|context cemented it's application. I've learned that code is sometimes better when you've got examples of code that illustrate it's function and implementation. </span><span style="color:#44F015">And that if we need help - our peers would come to our assistance which was an awesome thing to have and see - especially with problematic error messages [validated & solved via <span style="color:#F5F139">jsBin</span>].</span>
          </p>
          <p>  
            <span style="color:#F3B231">Something of a more <span style="color:white"><strong>'eloquent'</strong></span> approach was trying to figure out how to get my character|racecar to move. Seeing how many others used tables and the value "active" forced me to think - are we really restricted to just tables? Of all my peers, there was one who didn't rely on a table, but created an "arena" where his characters could move.</span><span style="color:#D9F203"> After <span style="color:#FE0241">pseudocoding</span> up my thoughts, I was surprised after inspecting their code to discover that they used three distinct code blocks, each wrapped in a function. <span style="color:#3EF3F6">The complexity and ingenuity of the coder told me that I could indeed learn alot from them.</span> I deliberately broke the code apart, changed it then waited to see how the browser would react to my changes, and quickly learned the functionality and output of the code.</span> Yes, I was challenging myself to understand what was happening by unravelling code, but learned so much that I adapted some of that thinking - and since it was a racing game, themed my racer accodingly.<span style="color:#0372FA"> I learned that I'm really confident with <span style="color:#7B47F6">HTML & CSS</span> and having prunes like <span style="color:#F5F139">JavaScript</span> along the way keeps things varied too.</span><span style="color:#FE0241"> Upon reflection, I need to be more open to engaging our coaches for their wisdom and experience and maybe then I will achieve things in a more timely fashion.</span>

            <span style="color:#289A41"><strong>.map()</strong> is a method applied to a list or array by defining a function for it to perform upon aforementioned list or array. If for example we had a bucket (array) of different coloured pegs (numbers || integers) yet I wanted them to be all <span style="color:#F793DA">pink</span>. <strong>.map()</strong> would take all the different coloured pegs and perform the function of making them all <span style="color:#F793DA">pink</span>.</span><br><span style="color:#C49010"><strong>.filler()</strong> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span><br><span style="color:#3275F2"><strong>.reduce()</strong> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx</span>
