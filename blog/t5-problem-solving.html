          <h2>Eating Prunes</h2>  
          <p>
            Getting blocked is an easy thing to do. Like breathing it is a natural part of a coding ecosystem.<br>One recurring problem I encountered was not understanding particular words within the JavaScript lexicon (like addEventListener); then searching for as many iterations and applications of that word in code.<br>Google is my first go to point as it gives me the illusion that I have the capability to find the answer. Sometimes though there is just too much info requiring specificity that it becomes overwhelming, then discouraging, that quickly becomes frustration resulting in a block.<br>Only later did I realise that I should've used Dev Tools to inspect my peers' code to see how many were using addEventListener and seeing it in ctx|context cemented it's application. I've learned that code is sometimes better when you've got examples of code that illustrate it's function and implementation. And that if we need help - our peers would come to our assistance which was an awesome thing to have and see - especially with problematic error messages (solved via jsBin)<br><br>
            Something of a more <strong><em>'eloquent'</em></strong> approach was trying to figure out how to get my character|racecar to move. Seeing how many others used tables and the active value forced me to think - are we really restricted to just tables?<br>Of all my peers, there was one who didn't rely on a table, but created an "arena" where his characters could move.<br>After psuedocoding up my thoughts, I was surprised after inspecting their code to discover that there code code was in 3 distinct code blocks, each wrapped in a function. The complexity and ingenuity of the coder told me that I could indeed learn alot from him.<br> I deliberately broke the code apart, changing it then waited to see how the browser would react to my changes, and I quickly learned the functionality and output of their code.<br>Yes, I was challenging myself to understand what was happening by unravelling code, but learned so much that I adapted some of that thinking - and since it was a racing game, themed my racer accodingly.<br> I learned that I'm really confident with HTML & CSS and having prunes like JavaScript along the way keeps things varied too.<br><br>Upon reflection, I need to be more open to engaging our coaches for their wisdom and experience.

          <p>
            Statements like <em>"if...else"</em> are conditional and only actioned when a certain criteria has been met. <br>So if we don't check the bread for mold we could get food poisoning or else we could check the remaining bread slices to see if they're okay.<br><br><strong>Loops</strong> maintain repetition until a condition is met. <br>So, if you happen to have a whole house of guests and you were on toast duty, your job would only be complete when everyone has had enough toast to eat.

          <h2>Accessing Data Arrays <br>vs. Object Literals</h2>  
          <p>
            <strong>Data Arrays</strong> are a fixed position (0-based index) of ordered elements that sit between square brackets and accessed by calling out a specific element from the array.<br>Eg. thisArray[4] would call the fifth item from thisArray.<br><br><strong>Object Literals</strong> stores relative data.<br>Eg. The object "phone" could have data pertaining to:             
            <ol>
              <li>manufacturer</li>
              <li>model</li>
              <li>date of manufacture</li>
              <li>available storage space</li>
              <li>colour</li>
            </ol>
          <p>This data is then accessed via <strong>dot notation</strong>, <br>Eg.phone.manufacturer<br><br>Or by <strong>bracket notation</strong>, <br>Eg.phone["available storage space"].

          <h2>Functions</h2>  
          <p>
            <strong>Functions</strong> are a block of code designed to perform a specific task. They contain <em>parameters</em> in curved brackets and the code to be executed in curly brackets.<br><br>The major advantage of using <strong>functions</strong> is that it allows you to define the code once, and then use it as many times it's required - which is not only a timesaver, but adheres to the acronym of <strong>DRY - Don't Repeat Yourself</strong>.
