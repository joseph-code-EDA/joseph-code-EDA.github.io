          <h4>Mindfulness Conversation</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                Hmmmmm...doing this activity with someone I know very well didn't exactly go per the book.<br><br>Because we're very familiar with one anothers idiosyncrasies it was hard to remain neutral while listening and dialoging.<br>In fact we were both in a heightened state of mindfulness that following the steps to having a mindful, meaningful conversation resulted in long periods of silence, awkward body language then laughter!<br><br>
                In retrospect, this mindful conversation would've been a lot easier with someone less familiar, new even while building trust and friendship.<br><br>I look forward to meeting my cohort peers and feel confident in utilizing this technique to bring about a state of whanaungatanga.

          <h4>Which Technique?</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                I actively practice <strong>Joyful Meditation</strong>.<br><br>At the core of my joy is a 9yr old girl who means the world to me. I need only think of her when I'm down or struggling to instantly change my thinking.<br>She empowers me like a battery making the seemingly impossible possible. It's hard to quantify how emotional motivation works - but it does!<br><br>The <strong>Open & Focused Attention Techniques</strong> come naturally during my daily activity - even during rest.<br>The dichotomy of this relationship acknowledges a peripheral awareness and mindfulness of the surrounding environment while enabling pinpoint accuracy when required.<br><br>If only these techniques were able to merged together and maintained - passive active mindfulness?!

          <h4>Any New Musings?</h4>

              <p id="answerform">
                This section was particularly insightful and offered lots of techniques to try. It also offered the disclaimer that turning a practice into a habit and subsequently into a routine requires internal and external motivation to be successful.<br><br>I'm excited by the notion of <em>"Gradual Effort & Sudden Enlightenment"</em> and that my progression, no matter how small adds up.<br><br>Just waiting on the enlightenment part to occur now.
