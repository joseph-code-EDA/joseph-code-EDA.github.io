    <h1>Time & Habits</h1>     
    <h2>Habits Tried</h2>
      <p>
        Meditation (Open Monitoring), Timebox, Ninja Mindset and Dwecks Growth Mindset.
      </p> 
    <h2>Anything Interesting?</h2>
      <p>
        Other than Pomodoro, The Fogg Method & Psychological Flow everything was super interesting and somewhat inter-related.
        It's fascinating how the concept of miniaturization - of task, of habit, of action, of time, of behaviour can lead to a more meaningful outcome.
        The Counterintuitive Productivity techniques were revealing - specifically on making things meaningful to us versus using productivity techniques that only trick us into accomplishing something.
        This means that I/we must learn to have a meaningful relationship with code, the tools and it's users - with IKE thrown in for good measure.
      </p>    
    <h2>What Worked?</h2>
      <p>
        Meditation was a conscious, deliberate part of our teaching philosophy in teaching Te Reo. The extrinisic/intrinsic benefits of this technique helped students focus and enjoy themselves while having fun interacting with the content and one another. I consider learning a consequence of such an environment, akin to the counterintuitive productivity model.
        The Timeboxing of activities (alongside Toggl) have helped keep me on task for today and a technique I'm willing to adopt over the coming weeks.
      </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The EDA curriculum and pedagogy has made me more aware of how time and habits can impact learning. 
        Most profound of all though was the adage "confidence is just displayed ability."
