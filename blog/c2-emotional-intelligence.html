    <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>     
    <h2>What was learned?</h2>
      <p>
        Emotional Intelligence (EI) can be cultivated, taught & learned. While leading to greater productivity, leadership and happiness, EI has the potential to optimize our psyhcological and physiological self. The statement "intuition is experienced in the body" is quite poignant in that we often discount our gut feeling and more often than not end up over analyzing something.

    <h2>Two Minute Mindfulness</h2>
      <p>
        Simply put - bliss. It creates a zen like state of heightened awareness and appreciation of everything in and around me. 
        This focussing technique also helps to disengage the brain, quietening the mind and opening it up to infinite possibilities.

        The word <b>"rongomomoe"</b> in Māori represents a state of "sleep" where the body is in a statis of complete rest yet fully aware of their surroundings. This is considered a prime state of learning, and a technique that connects us to our <b>Atua Māori</b>b (Gods), <b>tūpuna</b> (ancestors) and <b>puna mātauranga</b> (knowledge repositories) of old.
