    <h3>12 Jan 2016 : "Ka tere te takitahi, ka tawhiti te takitini"</h3>
    
    <p>
      I haven't felt so overwhelmed since I was at kura (school) and university and if I were honest with myself, I feel "dumb". Not in the sense that I don't know, but the enormity of it all - new concepts, new vocab, new (virtual) peers, new kaiako (teachers), new everything.
      After gaining access to this weeks mahi (tasks) my whole being went into shock (Toggl will attest to my first and last attempt on Day 1.) Nek minit, self doubt, negative talk consoled me before sleep took over. 
      </p> 

    <p>
      Last night however - something crazy occured, I had lucid dreams of some of the content I had read, but even better, I (eventually) saw myself becoming comfortable with it all.
      Suffice to say I woke up this morning reinvigorated, renewed with whakapono (faith) within the adage "Ka tere te takitahi, ka tawhiti te takitini" - If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go further, go together.
    </p>

      I will (git) commit myself to the repo known as Google and may even ask the odd "dumb" pƒÅtai (question) on Slack, but if after all of this I become the person I've visualised - it would all be worth it!
